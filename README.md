# Hand Cricket Game

This is a React Native mobile application which is based on a popular game played by children in India using just their hands (just like paper and scissors) which is
based on the bat and ball game of cricket. I used this to get familiarized with as well as practice application development in React Native.

# Objectives of Hand Cricket Game
The objective of both the players is to score more runs (or points) then the other to win. The players take turn 
for making the runs in each of two innings , the player who is scoring the runs is "Batting" during that innings and the other player stopping that player from 
scoring runs is "Bowling". After the current batting player runs out of wickets (number of outs), then we move to next innings and the roles are flipped. The player
in the second innings has to try to make more runs than the first player had made in the first innings batting while the player who had batted now assunmes the role
of bowling.

# What does this app simulate

In this app, you have assumed the role of batting and have to score as many runs as possible without losing all of your wickets. For each turn (delivery), you and
the opponent pick a number and if the number is the same then you lose a wicket otherwise the number you picked is added to your score. You have 10 wickets in hand
and can pick from 0 to 6.
